/* Some notes:
 *
 * (i) There is no SSL support on Arduino, it is unfeasible with
 * Arduino Uno or even Arduino Mega's computing power and memory limits.
 * All the traffic goes on the wire unencrypted and unsigned.
 *
 * (ii) We re-resolve the origin server IP address before each request.
 * This means some slow-down for intensive communication, but we rather
 * expect light traffic and very long-running sketches (days, months),
 * where refreshing the IP address is quite desirable.
 *
 * (iii) We let the users read replies at their leisure instead of
 * returning an already preloaded string so that (a) they can do that
 * in loop() code while taking care of other things as well (b) we don't
 * waste precious RAM by pre-allocating buffers that are never needed.
 *
 * (iv) If you are having problems connecting, maybe you have hit
 * a bug in Debian's version of Arduino pertaining the DNS code. Try using
 * an IP address as origin and/or upgrading your Arduino package.
 *
 * (v) The optional timeout parameter allows you to specify a timeout
 * period after which the subscribe call shall be retried. Note
 * that this timeout is applied only for reading response, not for
 * connecting or sending data; use retransmission parameters of
 * the Ethernet library to tune this. As a rule of thumb, timeout
 * smaller than 30 seconds may still block longer with flaky
 * network. Default server-side timeout of PubNub API is 300s.
 *
 * (vi) If some of the PubNub calls fail with your WiFi shield (e.g. you
 * see "subscribe error" and similar messages in serial console), your
 * WiFi shield firmware may be buggy - e.g. a WiFi shield bought
 * commercially in May 2013 had a firmware that had to be upgaded.
 * This is not so difficult to do, simply follow:
 *
 *   	http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/WiFiShieldFirmwareUpgrading
 *
 * (vii) The vendor firmware for the WiFi shield has dubious TCP implementation;
 * for example, TCP ports of outgoing connections are always chosen from the
 * same sequence, so if you reset your Arduino, some of the new connections
 * may interfere with an outstanding TCP connection that has not been closed
 * before the reset; i.e. you will typically see a single failed request
 * somewhere down the road after a reset.
 *
 * (viii) It is essential to use a new enough Arduino version so that
 * the WiFi library actually works properly. Most notably, version 1.0.5
 * has been confirmed to work while Arduino 1.0.4 is broken.
